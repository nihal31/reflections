it helps in version control duh .......used diff in cmdline to check difference in files
giving us more control over when to save the versions gives flexibility in what we r dong and generall y seems a good coding practice

becoz tracking more than one file at a time seems more sensible option

cloned a repo and checked all its versions and logs and diff like that!!


chcekout previous versions found out which one has bug!!

almost lesson1 over after changing some bashrc
